# challenge-5-work-day-scheduler


## My Task
 I had to create a work day scheduler that allows the user to save events for an eight hour work period. It uses HTML enhanced with JavaScript and JQuery and CSS. Day.jswas used for to get time and day information. Local storage is used to hold the user's information.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
